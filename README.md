# PURE Spring 2021, Autonomous Vehicle using the TI-RSLK 

## What is PURE and what is the TI-University program? 

PURE is an undergraduate research program at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign. Every semester volunteer mentors made up of graduate students are matched with students to conduct research and projects inspired by the graduate students field. You can find out more about PURE [here](https://pure.engr.illinois.edu/)

The TI-University program is for undergraduate students to have corporate projects, and use the TI-RSLK as the robotic platform.

## What is the project? 

The project is based on the TI-RSLK and aims to recreate the analog autonomous robot from the undergraduate level introductory class [ECE 110,Introduction to Electronics](https://courses.grainger.illinois.edu/ece110/fa2019/). The robot is built to navigate 
against multiple obstacles and uses limit switches to turn when encountering concave walls.
